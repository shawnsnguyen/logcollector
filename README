############# Problem/Requirements ################
A customer has asked you for a way to provide on-demand monitoring of various unix-based servers without having to log into each individual machine and opening up the log files found in /var/log. The customer has asked for the ability to issue a REST request to a machine in order to retrieve logs from /var/log on the machine receiving the REST request.

-Customer interface is a HTTP REST request
-Customer must be able to query the following:
	-for a specific file in /var/log
	-last n events of specified file
	-basic text/keyword filtering of events
-The results returned must be reverse time ordered
-Must not use any pre-built log aggregation systems - this must be custom, purpose-built software.
-Minimize the number of external dependencies in the business logic code path (framework things like HTTP servers, etc are okay)
-Please commit and push code changes as you normally would - your thinking and working style is an important part for us to understand.

Bonus: The customer has a stretch goal for the ability to issue a REST request to one “master” server in order to retrieve logs from a list of machines provided in the request. For this, there’s no requirements for the protocol between the master server and other servers.


############# Log Collector Overview ################
Each server will expose a list of logs available under /var/log via GET hostname:5000/list endpoint
-Locally the request would scan the current log files under /var/log and return the set of logs available
-Only supports uncompressed text format logs (e.g. doesnt work on gz/bz2 logs)

When fetching a specific file on a single host:
1. Server would open a file descriptor to the file if it exists (throwing an error if it doesnt, make sure to handle log rotations)
2. Skip thru log file until we hit the limit amount of events to return for the given log file. Note that if filters are specified,
the result would be a total of 'limit' amount of events that pass the filter.
For example:
If the request post data is '{"log_name":"system.log","log_event_count":"5","include_keywords":"Stat"}',
the result would be to find the last 5 log entries that include key word 'Stat' or min(limit, num_entries_matching_filter).
