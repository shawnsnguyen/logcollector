############# Log Collector Overview ################
Allows a user to send REST requests to query the following:
	-for a specific file in /var/log
	-last n events of specified file
	-basic text/keyword filtering of events

Each server will expose a list of logs available under /var/log via GET hostname:5000/list endpoint
-Locally the request would scan the current log files under /var/log and return the set of logs available
-Only supports uncompressed text format logs (e.g. doesnt work on gz/bz2 logs)

When fetching a specific file on a single host:
1. Server would open a file descriptor to the file if it exists (throwing an error if it doesnt, make sure to handle log rotations)
2. Skip thru log file until we hit the limit amount of events to return for the given log file. Note that if filters are specified,
the result would be a total of 'limit' amount of events that pass the filter.
For example:
If the request post data is '{"log_name":"system.log","log_event_count":"5","include_keywords":"Stat"}',
the result would be to find the last 5 log entries that include key word 'Stat' or min(limit, num_entries_matching_filter).
